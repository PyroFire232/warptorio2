Written using Microsoft Notepad.
IDE's are for children.

How to notepad like a pro:
ctrl+f = find
ctrl+h = find & replace
ctrl+g = show/jump to line (turn off wordwrap n00b)

Status bar wastes screen space, don't use it.

Use https://tools.stefankueng.com/grepWin.html to mass search, find and replace many files in bulk.
