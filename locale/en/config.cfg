1_3=Although you are unsure if you managed to achieve anything, you at least feel a bit more in control.

2_1=The memories of what happened begin to return to you. You were working on an experimental reactor that could distort and displace time and space.
2_2=You recall your early experiments and proceed to replicate them with the crude resources you've found on your journey so far.
2_3=The progress you feel you've made fills you with determination.

3_1=Ah yes, the experiment went bad! The Warp Reactor ruptured and tore a rift in localized warpspace fabric casting you and the warp platform into an alternate relative dimension in space.
3_2=You hastily assemble the warp reactor control panel from memory, but then stop when you realize you need the reactor core before they can function.
3_3=The feeling like you know what you need to do fills you with determination, if only you had the resources to do it.

4_1=Before the accident, you remember feeling excited about the endless applications of mastering the control of warpspace and became careless.
4_2=You have finished building the reactor warpdis and rift core, but you are not going to make the same mistakes twice.
4_3=Holding the pulsating warpdis in your hands fills you with determination.

5_1=You think you know why your experiment went wrong, the warpdis must be unstable unless maintained by perfectly reversing the polarity inversely squared to the rift core's inter-subdimensional artron energy matrix.

5_3=It's a risky strategy, but you believe this is your only chance to escape these savage alien infested worlds and get back to civilization.

6_1=A loud clash of energy ripples over your warp platform as the reactor shifts into existence, and you know this technology will uplift your civilization beyond their imagination.

6_3=The Warp Reactor finally now in place fills you with determination."},

7_1=You have developed a way to build a miniaturized warpdis connected to your reactors rift core, allowing the transfer of heat energy through warpspace
7_2=You believe this may be further refined into a way to rip chemical artron energy fuel cells out of warpspace through a perfect quasi-misalignment of the warpdis polarity.
7_3=This newfound flexible control over warpspace and time fills you with determination."},

8_1=You have almost lost track of how many worlds you have visited while adrift between dimensions, but you have discovered a way to measure the dimensional relativity of the artron energy signature emitted by the reactors rift core.
8_2=As a result, you are able to chart a map of where you have been, and what might lay ahead. But be wary, the Warp Reactor may not always agree with you, just like the day that started this all.
8_3=Your homeworld in your sights fills you with determination, and you marvel at the fruits of your final warpspace experiments.
